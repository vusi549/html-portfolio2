<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and versatile educator with a strong academic background in Computer Science, Electronics,<br/>
 and Education, supported by professional training in TEFL and a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE).<br/>
 My passion lies in creating engaging, learner-centered environments where students can build confidence,<br/>
 develop critical thinking skills, and master new concepts in both English and technology.</p>

<p>With formal qualifications ranging from Computer Science (Bachelor’s degree) to Honors-level study,<br/> 
I bring a rich understanding of computational thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy. <br/>
This technical foundation allows me to integrate modern, innovative teaching methods into my lessons, <br/>
especially in areas such as coding, robotics, and digital skills.</p>

<p>My PGCE training has equipped me with solid pedagogical strategies, classroom-management skills, <br/>
and curriculum design experience, enabling me to support diverse learning needs while maintaining <br/>
high academic standards. Combined with my TEFL certification, I am able to adapt my teaching approach<br/>
 for English language learners, helping them improve fluency, communication, and confidence in a<br/>
 supportive environment.</p>
 
 <p>I am committed to continuous growth, professionalism, and fostering a safe, respectful, and inspiring <br/>
 learning atmosphere. Whether working with children, teens, or adults, I strive to empower every learner <br/>
 and help them unlock their full potential—academically and personally.</p>
